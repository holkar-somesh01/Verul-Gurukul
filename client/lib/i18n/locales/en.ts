      title: 'Our History',
      description: "Gurukul system of education is an ancient tradition of India.Shri Krishna and Shri Ram studied in Gurukul in childhood.Mr.Babaji was a great saint of misfortune Shivayogi.He identified the pulse and hunger of the society and accordingly started the first Gurukul in a very simple small room at Shri Kshetra Verul in 1979. Accommodation and food were provided for the children and they grew up to the age of 10 by 1989. The students were admitted at a very low cost.Not stopping at that, he started Gurukul from 8th to 10th in Shri Kshetra Tunaki.All the students were staying in the hostel.In order to facilitate their food, Shri Babaji started the 'Gudhi Padwa,' the New Year's Grain Round.Food was provided to the children.Some devotees offer prayers, make donations and collect groceries on the occasion of Akshaya Tritiya.would have been.Later, an eighteen- room building was erected in the ashram at Verul.He used to attend gurukul classes and used to stay there.At Toonki, only the foundation of the building was laid by Shri Babaji.In this way, Shri Babaji had arranged 'Gurukul' in a simple way.He talked about many things...But who was aware of it at the time? Or maybe they didn't pay attention to us.The Samadhi of Shri Babaji was held at Shri Kshetra Kopargavi and a beautiful and grand Shodashi Shohal was held there on 25th December 1989. Thereafter, the ashram started functioning normally.I do not want to say that arrangements should be made for the children of the family...There was no reason for it to be here.So the rest of the serpent was sent to Verul.Also, there were other good reasons that they started harassing through court proceedings.That continues to this day.Nor did he ever show the need for the 'Gurukul tradition' of Shri Babaji.There is only greed for wealth.How to accept the mass of a great saint? Follow?...It can still be seen from their actions today.Shantigiri Baba wanted only one 'tradition of Shri Babaji' to continue and grow.And we are servants of the Guru's Ashram...This should be for everyone.Just like Mr.Ma.Narendra Modi is the Prime Minister.Baba thinks that the controversy is over.Don't make me yours.Don't argue.Believe that it is all God's."

      message: "There are three hundred and fifty boys in the Gurukul from Shri Babaji's Amritvani, that is what Baba wants to do. There is no God, no other God. The student is my god, the master is his companion. baba is very happy with both of them. Put the child in the 'gurukul' to make him polite. The Guru will be served and the family will be protected. This is the Gurukul... But if the Guru is gone, where will the Gurukul be? If the child does not go to the Gurukul, how will he get the sanskars? Bring your child to this school. Good luck to the boy! In the 'Skanda Purana' there is a saying in the mouth of Kartikeya Swami that if we want to grow up, the first knowledge is study. What should be the description of the children who have had the company of saints in childhood. At the feet of Sadhguru are all the Tirthas, all the Vratas. No matter how big the defect is, the ritual destroys that defect. Anyone can do it, but do it for yourself. Serve the students, so you will get a big position, but in a formless way. If I want to see, look at the boys in the gurukul and the cattle in the gaushala. If I want to eat, I have to feed the boys in the Gurukul. That means I get to eat. My job is to serve poor students. Whoever serves these students, I will like them and they will also get knowledge. If you want to give education to boys, then from fifth to eighth grade boys listen, after ninth grade boys do not listen, so for this rite put the boys in the Gurukul. Because a child in the company of saints sometimes becomes an expert.",
